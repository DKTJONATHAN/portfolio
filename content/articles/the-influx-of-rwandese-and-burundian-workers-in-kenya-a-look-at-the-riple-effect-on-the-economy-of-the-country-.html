              <p class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">Kenyan workers are complaining of the influx of Rwandese and Burundian workers who have flooded the Kenyan Job market with cheap labor.</p>
              <p><br></p><p><strong>NAIROBI</strong>, Kenya, A surge of economic migration from Burundi and Rwanda is transforming Kenya’s labor market, particularly in low-skilled sectors, raising concerns among locals about job displacement and wage suppression. In urban centers like Nairobi, Thika, and Mombasa, Burundian and Rwandese migrants are increasingly filling roles in construction, barbering, nail salons, and informal trade, often accepting wages far below local standards. This trend, while cost-effective for employers, is making it harder for Kenyans to secure jobs in an already competitive market, worsening economic challenges for the working class.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Labor Market Under Pressure</strong></p><p>Kenya, East Africa’s economic hub, attracts migrants due to its stability and opportunities. The country hosts over 1 million immigrants, including significant numbers from Somalia, Uganda, South Sudan, and, increasingly, Burundi and Rwanda, per the International Organization for Migration (IOM). While Somalia and South Sudan contribute many refugees, Burundians and Rwandese are often economic migrants seeking better prospects amid political instability and limited opportunities in their home countries.</p><p><br></p><p>In Kenya’s informal sector, particularly construction (locally called "mjengo"), the impact is clear. Non-skilled construction jobs, previously paying 600–700 Kenyan Shillings (KES) per day, are now offered to Burundian and Rwandese workers for 300–350 KES. This wage gap makes it tough for Kenyan workers, many supporting families, to compete. “<strong><em>Employers choose foreigners because they work for less,</em></strong>” said James Otieno, a 34-year-old construction worker in Nairobi’s Kasarani area. “<strong><em>I can’t accept 300 shillings a day. It’s not enough to survive.</em></strong>”</p><p><br></p><p>Low-income Kenyans are particularly affected. In areas like Sunton and Mwiki, Burundian and Rwandese migrants dominate small businesses like barbering, nail salons, and hawking. Burundian nail technicians and barbers earn around 500 KES daily, more than in their home countries but below Kenyan expectations. Living in shared accommodations, migrants can accept lower wages, a flexibility many Kenyans lack.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Economic and Social Impacts</strong></p><p>Migrant workers fill labor gaps in sectors often ignored by locals, offering affordable services and boosting economic activity. A Burundian barber in Thika noted his lower prices attract cost-conscious customers. Rwandese hawkers in Gikomba market buy goods in bulk and sell at competitive rates, serving Kenya’s nightlife economy.</p><p><br></p><p>However, wage suppression is creating broader issues. Kenyan workers report being sidelined as employers prioritize cheaper labor, fueling resentment. “<strong><em>We fought for better wages, and now we’re pushed out because someone works for half the price</em></strong>,” said Mary Wambui, a single mother and former domestic worker in Nairobi. Kenya’s youth, facing a 20% unemployment rate in the formal sector, rely on informal jobs now threatened by this trend.</p><p><br></p><p>Economists warn that while cheap labor benefits businesses short-term, it could worsen poverty and inequality long-term. Kenya’s GDP growth, projected at 4.9% for 2025–2027 by the World Bank, relies on private consumption and investment, but these gains aren’t reaching the poorest. With 34% of Kenyans living below the $2.15 daily poverty line, job displacement risks deepening hardship. The informal sector, employing over 80% of Kenya’s workforce, is highly sensitive to wage changes, amplifying the impact of low-cost migrant labor.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>A Complex Migration Dynamic</strong></p><p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/g0f80Wzt/industrialize.jpg" alt="Embedded image" class="content-image" /></p><p>This influx is part of a regional migration trend, enabled by Kenya’s open borders and support for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). President William Ruto has advocated for free movement to foster economic integration, as stated at the ACFTA conference in Nairobi on November 7, 2023. For Burundians like Irambona, a nail technician in Sunton, Kenya offers better prospects than home, where earnings were a third of current levels.</p><p>Yet, this vision conflicts with local realities. Kenya’s labor market is strained, with 1 million new workers annually but only 20% finding formal jobs. The government’s push to export labor to countries like Germany and Saudi Arabia via the 2024 Labour Migration Management Bill complicates matters. Critics argue that while outward migration is encouraged, unregulated inward migration leaves local workers vulnerable.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Voices of the Affected</strong></p><p>Pierre, a Burundian barber in Kasarani, came to Kenya after hearing about demand for his skills. “<strong><em>I work hard because I have no other option,</em></strong>” he said. “<strong><em>In Burundi, I couldn’t save. Here, I can.</em></strong>” Bigirimana, a Rwandese boda boda operator in Thika, values Kenya’s relaxed regulations compared to Rwanda’s restrictions.</p><p>Conversely, Kenyan workers like Otieno feel stuck. “<strong><em>I’ve done mjengo for 10 years, but now I’m losing jobs to people working for next to nothing,</em></strong>” he said. Wambui, who lost her domestic worker job to a migrant accepting lower pay, added, “<strong><em>It’s not fair. We just want a chance to earn a living.</em></strong>”</p><p><br></p><p> <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/XJ6MkrNf/Hawkers.jpg" alt="Embedded image" class="content-image" /></p><p><strong>Proposed Solutions and a Bleak Outlook</strong></p><p>Addressing this issue requires balancing regional integration with protecting local workers. Proposed measures include:</p><p><strong><em>1. Wage Regulation and Enforcement: Set and enforce minimum wages for informal jobs, with inspections and penalties to prevent undercutting.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>2. Skills Training for Local Workers: Vocational programs to enhance Kenyan workers’ skills, making them more competitive.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>3. Migration Policy Reform: Cap work permits for low-skilled jobs in oversaturated sectors, prioritizing Kenyans.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>4. Public Awareness Campaigns: Educate employers on wage suppression’s long-term effects and promote solidarity between local and migrant workers.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>5. Job Creation Initiatives: Invest in agriculture, manufacturing, and the digital economy to absorb local workers, per Kenya’s Vision 2030.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Despite these ideas, the outlook under President Ruto’s administration is grim. Critics argue his focus on regional integration and labor exports overlooks domestic workers’ needs. The government’s failure to address unemployment and regulate inward migration fuels perceptions of prioritizing foreign interests. With public discontent rising—evidenced by the 2024 anti-tax protests—and economic struggles persisting, many Kenyans feel their challenges will worsen. Without urgent action, low-wage migrant labor could further erode livelihoods, leaving Kenya’s economic promise out of reach for its most vulnerable.</p>
