# Test Blog Post

This is a sample blog post created to test the rendering of Markdown files on the blog page. It includes a properly formatted frontmatter and some sample content.

## Why This Post Exists
This post is designed to ensure that:
- The `/api/list-posts` endpoint fetches the file correctly.
- The frontmatter is parsed without errors.
- The blog page displays the post title, date, category, tags, image, and excerpt.

## Sample Content
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. This is a test paragraph to verify that the content renders correctly using the `marked` library.

- Point 1: Testing lists.
- Point 2: Ensuring proper Markdown parsing.
