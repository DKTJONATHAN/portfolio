            <p>As a web developer based in Nairobi, I've seen firsthand how quickly our industry changes. Just when you think you've mastered a technology, something new comes along that changes the game completely. In this article, I'll share the top web development trends that are shaping 2025, with a special focus on what this means for developers and businesses here in Kenya.</p>
            
            <h2>1. AI-Powered Development Tools</h2>
            <p>The integration of artificial intelligence into development workflows has gone from nice-to-have to absolutely essential in 2025. Tools like GitHub Copilot have evolved into full-fledged AI pair programmers that can:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Generate entire component templates based on natural language descriptions</li>
                <li>Automatically fix common bugs and suggest optimizations</li>
                <li>Convert legacy code to modern frameworks with minimal effort</li>
                <li>Generate test cases with impressive accuracy</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Here in Kenya, we're seeing more developers adopt these tools to compete globally. At Jamhuri Tech Hub, where I occasionally mentor, over 60% of developers now use AI-assisted coding daily.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Web3 and Blockchain Integration</h2>
            <p>While the crypto hype has cooled, the underlying blockchain technology has found practical applications in web development:</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                // Example of a simple smart contract interaction in JavaScript
                const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);
                contract.methods.balanceOf(userAddress).call()
                  .then(balance => {
                    console.log(`User balance: ${balance}`);
                  });
            </div>
            
            <p>Kenyan businesses are particularly adopting Web3 for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Secure land registry systems (we're working with several counties on this)</li>
                <li>Supply chain transparency for agricultural exports</li>
                <li>Micropayment systems that work across mobile money platforms</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>3. Advanced Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</h2>
            <p>PWAs have become the standard for mobile-first markets like Kenya where data costs and device limitations matter. The 2025 enhancements include:</p>
            
            <img src="../images/pwa-example.jpg" alt="PWA Example in Kenya" class="blog-image">
            <p class="blog-image-caption">A PWA for a Nairobi-based delivery service showing offline functionality</p>
            
            <h3>Why this matters for Kenya:</h3>
            <p>With our mobile-first population, PWAs offer a way to deliver app-like experiences without requiring expensive smartphones or constant data connections. I've helped several matatu SACCOS convert their apps to PWAs, resulting in 40% more daily users.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Voice Search Optimization</h2>
            <p>With Swahili and local language voice search growing rapidly (thanks to improved NLP for African languages), optimizing for voice search is no longer optional:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                "Haki ya mtoto" used to return child rights articles. Now it understands context and can return specific legal services in your area.
            </blockquote>
            
            <h2>5. WebAssembly (Wasm) Maturity</h2>
            <p>WebAssembly has moved beyond experiments to powering real applications. In Kenya, we're seeing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Agricultural apps running complex soil analysis in the browser</li>
                <li>Medical imaging tools that work offline</li>
                <li>CAD tools for engineering students</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Final Thoughts for Kenyan Developers</h2>
            <p>While it's exciting to chase every new trend, the key is to focus on technologies that solve real problems for our market. The most successful Kenyan developers I know combine technical skills with deep understanding of local needs.</p>
